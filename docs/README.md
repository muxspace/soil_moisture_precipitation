# Research assignments

## File format
Research homework must be written in a RMarkdown file.
This ensures consistency across work.

Use the example `hw01-rowe.Rmd` as a template for the assignments.

## File naming convention
Assignment files must follow the naming scheme `hw<num>-<last name>.Rmd`,
where num is a 0-padded number.
For example, for my assignment 1, it would be `hw01-rowe.Rmd`.

## Bibliography
All students will use the same bibliography file, 
which is named `biblio.bib`.
Be sure to fetch the latest changes from `origin` prior to adding your
own entries.

## Rendering the document
If you are on Linux, you can use the shell script in the parent directory
`make_doc.sh` to generate the PDF document.
Otherwise you can use the R code within that document to render it
from the R console.
